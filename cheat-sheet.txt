This article will provide you with a breakdown of the major areas of the Snort IDS and everything you need to know about it. If you need more in-depth knowledge, check out the Snort documentation at: https://www.snort.org/#documents. If you are looking for an in-depth tutorial on how to install the software, check out our article at: https://srcport.com/articles/security/298/setup-snort-ids-on-windows/.

Throughout this article, Snort commands are displayed in green text, while important information is displayed in orange text.

Key Words

Data Acquisition Library (DAQ) - Library used to make network card calls.
Preprocessors are modules that run in snort before the detection engine.

Key Commands

-l Save output to file.
-D Configure snort as hidden daemon.
-O Obfuscate IP addresses for publication.
-T Test the config file.

Snort Modes

There are three modes that the IDS can operate in:

Sniffer Mode - Simply reads packets and displays them on screen.

Packet Logger Mode - Logs the packets to disk.

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - Performs detection and analysis on network traffic.



While in sniffer mode you can use a combination of the flags -v -d -e to display the IP (TCP, UDP, ICMP) headers, the data and the headers and data respectively. 

While in packet logger mode you can use the -l flag to set a location where the packets should be logged. For smaller file sizes use the -b flag for binary mode. If you wish to read a file into snort use the -r flag. You can use Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) on the command line as well, so if you only wanted to view ICMP files, just pass in the icmp flag.

While in NIDS mode you can specify an output file with -l as well as do anything mentioned in the previous two modes. You can pass in an IP address or range with the -h flag. In addition you can set the flagging mode with the following flags:

-A fast - Simple timestamp format.

-A full - Full alerts (default).

-A none - Disable alerts.


Alerts come in the format of [**] [116:56:1] (snort_decoder): T/TCP Detected [**] where the numbers in order represent:

Generator ID (GID) - The ID of the component that generated the alert.

Snort ID (SID) - The signature ID

Revision ID (RID) - If the signature was changed it'll have an associated ID.

Configuring Snort

The include <file> key word can be used to include files in the snort.config file.

# are comments. 

Snort Rules

Most snort rules are written in a single line, multi-line rules were recently introduced and can be spotted with a \ on the end of the line.

There are 8 actions available to rule creators once malicious activity has been detected:

alert - Generate a warning and log the packet.

log - Just log the packet.

pass - Ignore the packet.

activate - Generate alert and execute dynamic rule.

dynamic - Remain idle until activated by an activate rule

drop - Block and log the packet.

reject - block the packet, log it and respond to the protocol (e.g., TCP RST)

sdrop - Block but don't log



The -> arrow indicates the directionality of the connection. The <> arrow indicates bidirectionality. 

Snort rules are separated by semicolons ;

The msg:"<words>" keyword tells Snort to print out the message.

Each rule must have a SID, custom rules should start at the index 1000000 for example 10000001. 

The ! symbol can be used for negation.
